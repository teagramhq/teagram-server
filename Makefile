# -race is not optional here: the hard parts of this server are ordering
# (Conn.Push/writeMu, per-owner pts, store lock ordering), and a plain run
# passes a build that corrupts state under concurrent load.
#
# e2e runs in its own invocation with -count=1, and the packages below exclude
# it so it is not run twice. Go caches a test result keyed on the package's
# sources and recorded inputs, so a commit that changed only another package
# replays e2e's earlier result — the run then reports success for an
# end-to-end path that never started on that commit. That is exactly the layer
# where wiring and environment breakage shows up, so it is re-run every time;
# every other package keeps its cache.
#
# -timeout 15m: Go's default 10m killed a healthy run at 602s under CPU
# contention (observed runtime ~300s). 15m gives 3x headroom while staying
# inside CI's timeout-minutes: 20 so Go's goroutine dump fires before GitHub
# cancels the job.

# `make test` (including e2e) remains the pre-PR gate. CI uses this non-e2e
# target and runs the same uncached e2e command with JSON output for safe
# failure attribution. The exact-cap fleet writer runs separately after the
# non-e2e package tests so shared Postgres load does not consume its deadline.

# Inside a container the host is shared with other test runs, and tg-test-pg is
# shared with them too — it is keyed only by name. Ryuk, testcontainers' reaper,
# SIGKILLs that container when *its own* session's last binary exits, taking
# every concurrent run down with it ("unexpected EOF", then connection refused
# against the old IP). CI disables it for the same reason. Off only in a
# container, where the sandbox is thrown away anyway; on a laptop it stays on so
# a leaked container does not outlive the run.

# pgtest starts its Postgres on Docker's default bridge network. When the tests
# themselves run inside a container attached to some other user-defined network,
# the two networks are isolated and every DB test dies on a connect timeout to
# 172.17.x.x. Joining the bridge restores the route. Skipped entirely when not
# running in a container.
#
# Joining also hands the bridge's gateway the container's default route, and
# nothing puts the old one back — from the first `make test` onward every
# non-local packet leaves by a gateway the container did not boot with.
# --gw-priority=-100 joins for reachability while losing the gateway election,
# so the user-defined network keeps the default route. It needs Docker 28
# (API 1.48); an older daemon refuses the flag, and setup must not start
# failing where it used to work, so we retry plainly and say what moves.
#
# A daemon reached over a TCP DOCKER_HOST rather than a bind-mounted socket — a
# DinD sidecar — has never heard of this container, so it answers "No such
# container" and no join is possible there. None is needed either: that
# daemon's bridge subnet is not ours to route to, and pgtest already probes the
# bridge address and falls back to the published port, which testcontainers
# resolves against the daemon's host. So that one answer is a skip, and it is
# still an answer: it proves the daemon is up and talking, which is what this
# target checks for. Postgres being unreachable after that stays loud in
# pgtest's own setup, which names the host and port it gave up on.
#
# That skip is gated on the topology, not on the message, because the same
# message means something else on a local socket: /etc/hostname is not the
# container's Docker name under --hostname or pod-style networking, and there
# the join really is needed and really did not happen. So on a local socket
# (DOCKER_HOST unset or unix://) "No such container" stays loud, as does every
# other failure — a silent one here buys back the exact timeout this target
# exists to prevent, minutes later and looking like a broken test.
#
# A container already on the bridge keeps whatever priority it joined with;
# `docker network disconnect bridge <name>` once, then rerun.
