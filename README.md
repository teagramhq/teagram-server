# telegram-server

An MTProto (Telegram protocol) server in Go, built on [gotd](https://github.com/gotd/td)'s
exported packages (transport, key exchange, crypto and proto) with the accept
loop, session bookkeeping and RPC dispatch implemented in this repository. It is
a single-DC server: auth keys, sessions, users, messages and files persist in
Postgres, so a restart keeps them. Real gotd clients (including the in-repo e2e
suite) can complete the full key exchange, sign in and exchange messages against
it; `docs/clients.md` covers connecting clients, including a patched Telegram
Desktop.

Two ways to sign in:

- **Username + password**: SRP-6a cloud-password accounts that authenticate
  with a username and password, no code delivery involved. Sign-up is gated by
  `TG_REGISTRATION` (default `closed`). The first account admitted on a fresh
  database becomes the durable server administrator; startup never creates or
  changes accounts.
- **Phone number + login code**: there is no SMS or push transport, so codes
  are written to the server log, and only when `TG_LOG_LOGIN_CODES=true`.
  Development against fake numbers only.

This is a development and research server, not something to expose to the
internet.

## Architecture

A request flows top to bottom:

```
gotd client
    |  MTProto over TCP (:2443)
    v
internal/mtproto     accept loop, key exchange, session bookkeeping,
    |                message dispatch (on gotd's exported packages)
    v
internal/api         the MTProto RPC method handlers
    |
    v
internal/store       Postgres persistence: pgx, with sqlc-generated
    |                queries in internal/store/db
    v
Postgres             schema from migrations/, applied with atlas
```

In prose: a gotd client connects to `internal/mtproto`, which owns the accept
loop, key exchange and session bookkeeping and dispatches each RPC to
`internal/api`'s handlers, which read and write through `internal/store` to
Postgres.

`cmd/telegramd` wires this together from the environment variables
`internal/config` reads, and when `TG_ADMIN_LISTEN_ADDR` is set it also serves
`internal/admin` (read-only operational metrics and dashboard) on a separate
admin-only HTTP listener.

Supporting packages: `internal/rsakey` (server RSA identity for the auth-key
exchange), `internal/keycrypt` (AES-256-GCM sealing of auth keys at rest),
`internal/srp` (server side of Telegram's SRP-6a cloud password / 2FA),
`internal/peerhash` (per-viewer peer access hashes), `internal/blob` (opaque
blob storage for uploaded file bodies), `internal/pgtest` (the Postgres test
harness).

The schema is managed with [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io) migrations in
`migrations/`; queries are written as SQL in `internal/store/queries` and
compiled to Go by [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev) into `internal/store/db`.

## Requirements

- **Go 1.27+** (`go.mod`)
- **Docker**: required for the tests (the Postgres harness starts a
  `postgres:16-alpine` container), for Atlas's dev database, and for the
  compose stack
- **Atlas CLI**: migrations; CI and the compose stack pin `v1.2.0`
  ([install](https://atlasgo.io/getting-started))
- **golangci-lint**: `make lint`; CI pins `v2.14.0`
- **sqlc**: not installed separately; `make sqlc` builds the pinned binary
  from the `tools/` module into `./bin/sqlc`
- **Node 22 + pnpm 10**: only for the Playwright admin-dashboard e2e suite

`make tools-check` verifies the sqlc and atlas toolchain.

## Quick start (Docker Compose)

The fastest way to a running server. Postgres, migrations and the server, in
order:

```bash
cp .env.example .env && chmod 600 .env
docker compose up
```

The server listens on `127.0.0.1:2443`. The stack enables
`TG_LOG_LOGIN_CODES`, so phone-mode login codes appear in
`docker compose logs telegramd`; phone-mode accounts must already exist because
sign-in no longer creates unknown accounts. Username/password accounts are also
supported here: for a fresh database, temporarily set `TG_REGISTRATION=open` in
`.env`, complete the registration flow in [the client guide](docs/clients.md),
and then set it back to `closed`. The first committed account becomes the
durable server administrator. `docker compose down` keeps
the local volumes (rows, RSA identity, auth-key master key, and filesystem
blobs); `down -v` destroys them and every client has to re-handshake.
`.env.example` documents each variable.

To run the same stack with the S3-compatible RustFS backend, use the tracked
local-only overlay. It starts RustFS, creates the `telegram` bucket, and
selects a separate named RustFS data volume in one command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.rustfs.yml up
```

The overlay uses fixed throwaway credentials and loopback-only plaintext HTTP.
Use the same two files with `down` when stopping it; `down -v` also destroys
the RustFS data volume. Do not copy this overlay's endpoint, credentials, or
HTTP setting into a deployment.

## Build and run locally

```bash
make build   # go build ./...
make run     # go run ./cmd/telegramd
```

Configuration is environment variables, read in `internal/config/config.go`.
The server refuses to start without a database, a master key, and a public link
prefix:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TG_POSTGRES_DSN` | *(required)* | Postgres connection string, migrated schema (see below) |
| `TG_AUTHKEY_ENC_KEY` | *(one of two required)* | 64 hex chars, the AES-256-GCM master key over stored auth keys. Alternatively set `TG_AUTHKEY_ENC_KEY_FILE` to read/generate the key from a file; one of the two must be set |
| `TG_LISTEN_ADDR` | `:2443` | Address the MTProto listener binds |
| `TG_WEBSOCKET_LISTEN_ADDR` | *(unset)* | Enables the WebSocket MTProto listener on this address; browser clients connect to `/apiws` |
| `TG_WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | *(unset)* | Comma-separated browser origins allowed to connect to `/apiws`; unset rejects every request carrying an `Origin` header |
| `TG_ADVERTISE_ADDR` | *(derived from `TG_LISTEN_ADDR`)* | Public `host:port` written to the discovery document and advertised to clients |
| `TG_PUBLIC_LINK_PREFIX` | *(required)* | Lowercase HTTPS origin for client and invite links, with a root path and no port (e.g. `https://links.example.test/`) |
| `TG_RSA_KEY_PATH` | `server_key.pem` | Server RSA private key; generated on first start |
| `TG_BLOB_DIR` | `blobs` | Where uploaded file bodies are written |
| `TG_BLOB_S3_ENDPOINT` | *(unset)* | Enables the S3-compatible blob backend when non-empty; requires the other `TG_BLOB_S3_*` settings below |
| `TG_BLOB_S3_BUCKET` | *(unset)* | Private bucket containing blobs |
| `TG_BLOB_S3_PREFIX` | *(unset)* | Required non-root prefix assigned to this server |
| `TG_BLOB_S3_REGION` | `us-east-1` | SigV4 signing region |
| `TG_BLOB_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | *(unset)* | Operations-only object-store access key |
| `TG_BLOB_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | *(unset)* | Raw secret accepted only for compose or CI secret injection; prefer the file form |
| `TG_BLOB_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_FILE` | *(unset)* | Preferred file containing the object-store secret; the file is read at startup |
| `TG_BLOB_S3_CA_PATH` | *(unset)* | PEM bundle for a private endpoint CA; TLS verification remains enabled |
| `TG_BLOB_S3_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP` | `false` | Explicit loopback/compose-only plaintext opt-in; startup warns when enabled |
| `TG_DC_ID` | `2` | DC id the server advertises |
| `TG_RATE_LIMIT_DISCOVERY` | `60` | Cluster-wide valid local-direct preflight response attempts per fixed window, counted in Postgres; `0` disables the bound |
| `TG_RATE_LIMIT_DISCOVERY_WINDOW` | `1m` | Window for the cluster-wide discovery response bound |
| `TG_RATE_LIMIT_DISCOVERY_IP` | `10` | Valid local-direct preflight response attempts per IPv4 `/32` or IPv6 `/64` network per fixed window, shared through Postgres; `0` disables the bound |
| `TG_RATE_LIMIT_DISCOVERY_IP_WINDOW` | `1m` | Window for the per-network discovery response bound |
| `TG_REGISTRATION` | `closed` | Accepted values are `closed`, `invite`, and `open`; `closed` rejects `auth.signUp`, `invite` requires an operator-issued invite, and `open` admits usernames without one. An unrecognized value fails startup |
| `TG_LOG_LOGIN_CODES` | `false` | Write phone-mode login codes to the log; with it off, phone-number sign-in cannot complete (username/password sign-in is unaffected) |
| `TG_ADMIN_LISTEN_ADDR` | *(unset)* | Enables the admin HTTP server; requires `TG_ADMIN_TOKEN_HASH` (SHA-256 hex of the operator token) |
| `TG_ADMIN_TOKEN_HASH` | *(unset)* | Lowercase SHA-256 hex digest of the admin token; must be set with `TG_ADMIN_LISTEN_ADDR` and never contains the raw token |
| `TG_ADMIN_ORIGIN` | *(unset)* | Fixed browser origin for admin login/logout; HTTPS for remote proxy origins, or HTTP for localhost and loopback IPs. Unset/blank derives it from the listener. See `docs/observability.md` |
| `TG_REPLICA_ID` | *(unset)* | Optional stable operator-supplied identity shown on authenticated admin metrics; 1–64 characters from `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `.`, `_`, and `-` |
| `TG_REPLICA_COUNT` | `1` | Number of running `telegramd` replicas. Set the same value on every replica; it divides local connection budgets. A non-zero local budget smaller than this count fails startup |
| `TG_MAX_PREAUTH_CONNS` | `1024` | Deployment-wide cap on unauthenticated connections, split among replicas; `0` disables it |
| `TG_MAX_PREAUTH_CONNS_PER_IP` | `64` | Deployment-wide unauthenticated connection cap per IPv4 `/32` or IPv6 `/64`, split among replicas; `0` disables it |
| `TG_PREAUTH_LIFETIME` | `2m` | Per-connection ceiling before an unauthenticated connection is closed; `0` disables it |
| `TG_MAX_CONNS_PER_UNBOUND_KEY` | `8` | Deployment-wide connection cap for each auth key with no signed-in user, split among replicas; `0` disables it |
| `TG_MAX_PENDING_LOGIN_CONNS` | `1024` | Cluster-wide concurrent connections waiting for `auth.checkPassword`, held in Postgres leases; `0` disables it |
| `TG_MAX_FILE_BYTES` | `100 MiB` | Maximum size of one uploaded file |
| `TG_MAX_USER_STORAGE_BYTES` | `2 GiB` | Lifetime uploaded-file quota per account; enforced from shared Postgres file metadata |
| `TG_RPC_DEADLINE` | `23s` | Per-RPC execution deadline; `0` disables it |
| `TG_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT` | `17s` | Per-Postgres-statement timeout; `0` disables it |
| `TG_RATE_LIMIT_GET_FILE` | `50` | Per-account `upload.getFile` calls per fixed window, counted in Postgres and shared across replicas; `0` disables the bound |
| `TG_RATE_LIMIT_GET_FILE_WINDOW` | `1s` | Window for the per-account `upload.getFile` rate limit |
| `TG_RATE_LIMIT_GET_FILE_REPLICA` | `400` | Aggregate `upload.getFile` calls across all accounts and replicas per fixed window, counted in Postgres; `0` disables the bound |
| `TG_RATE_LIMIT_GET_FILE_REPLICA_WINDOW` | `1s` | Window for the aggregate `upload.getFile` rate limit |

### Server limit inventory

For a multi-replica deployment, set `TG_REPLICA_COUNT` to the maximum number of
copies that can run at once and use the same value and limit configuration on
each copy. The local connection shares use integer division, so the fleet stays
at or below each configured total; capacity left over by division is unused. If
the replica count exceeds any enabled local connection budget, startup fails.
If the fleet runs below the configured maximum, its available connection
capacity is lower by design. A rollout that changes the count must not leave
replicas running with different values, since each process enforces only its
configured share.

| Limit | State and replica scope |
|---|---|
| RPC and discovery rate limits | Shared Postgres counters in `rate_limits` for account, client-network and global surfaces. This includes message sends, chat/channel creation and membership, message/contact searches, poll votes, upload parts and downloads, authentication/password surfaces, profile updates, local discovery, and the aggregate `upload.getFile` budget. `auth.sendCode` uses the shared `send_code_ip_calls` and `send_code_ip_phones` tables; failed `auth.signIn` uses `sign_in_fail_calls`. |
| Admin login attempts | Shared Postgres `rate_limits` counter per client network: five attempts per 30-second fixed window. Requests past the cap wait two seconds. |
| Concurrent `auth.checkPassword` waits, per-account `upload.getFile` in-flight calls, and admin event streams | Shared Postgres `server_limit_leases` rows. The defaults are 1024 pending logins, one in-flight download per account, and 32 admin streams; each stream is recycled after 25 minutes. Owners release leases on exit; expiry and the rate-limit sweeper reclaim slots after a replica stops unexpectedly. |
| Unauthenticated sockets, per-network socket caps, unbound auth-key connections, and live connections per account | In-memory counters in each replica, divided from deployment totals by `TG_REPLICA_COUNT`. Defaults are 1024 unauthenticated sockets, 64 per IPv4 `/32` or IPv6 `/64`, 8 per unbound auth key, and 20 live connections per account. |
| Persistent account and entity quotas | Checked against Postgres rows and transaction state, so replicas share the same totals. This includes the 2 GiB lifetime uploaded-file quota, 5000 contacts per account, 20 distinct phone lookups per day, 100 distinct username lookups per day and 20 per minute, two username changes per day per account or channel, 500 channels per account, 10,000 participants per channel, 200 members per basic chat, 100 peers and 12 entities per dialog filter, and up to 10 outstanding secret-chat requests. File bytes live in the configured blob store; Postgres owns their quota metadata. |
| Per-operation protocol and resource bounds | Stateless bounds are applied independently to each request by the replica handling it: 100 MiB file size, 512 KiB upload parts, 1 MiB download chunks, RPC argument/page sizes, admin request-body size, pre-auth lifetime, RPC deadline, and Postgres statement timeout. They do not use a fleet counter. |
| Per-connection queues and internal worker pools | Bounded channels and worker slots live in the process that owns the connection or database pool. They bound that replica's memory and local work; their capacity follows active connections and the configured pool size rather than a deployment-wide quota. |

The full per-surface rate defaults and environment variables are in
[`docs/clients.md`](docs/clients.md). The authenticated admin metrics contract,
reset semantics, fleet aggregation rules, tracing posture, and operator runbook
are in [`docs/observability.md`](docs/observability.md).

### Publish a client discovery document

After configuring the advertised endpoint, DC and RSA key, render the public
file without Postgres or the auth-key master key:

```bash
telegramd client-config > client.json
```

Serve that file from the HTTPS origin at
`/.well-known/telegramd/client`. The command only renders the file; telegramd
does not run an HTTPS listener or publish to a web root. The full JSON and
local-direct preflight contract, including PROXY-v2 ordering, rate limits and
the residual first-contact TOFU risk, is in `docs/clients.md`.

### Object-store backend

With all `TG_BLOB_S3_*` variables unset or empty, uploaded blobs use the local
filesystem at `TG_BLOB_DIR`, exactly as before. Setting any object-store
variable to a non-empty value selects S3 mode and requires an endpoint, bucket,
non-empty prefix, access key, and exactly one secret source. The server validates
the S3 client
and lists the configured namespace before it opens for service; a failed check
stops startup and never falls back to local storage.

Use `TG_BLOB_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_FILE` for the secret. The file should be
readable by the server process and contain only the secret, optionally followed
by a newline. The raw `TG_BLOB_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` form is accepted for
compose or CI secret injection only; do not put it in a developer shell,
checked-in environment file, command line, or ordinary process environment.

The access key must be scoped to operations on this one bucket and this one
prefix: list, get, put, and delete objects below the prefix only. Do not grant
bucket-root, wildcard, ACL, or policy-management permissions. The server does
not set object ACLs; keep the bucket private.

Switching a deployment that already has local filesystem blobs to S3 is a
manual data move. There is no automated migration path: copy and verify the
existing objects into the configured bucket and prefix before switching the
backend. RustFS has no backup in this project; its named volume is persistence,
not a backup or restore mechanism.

HTTPS certificate verification is always enabled. Set
`TG_BLOB_S3_CA_PATH` only when the endpoint uses a private CA bundle. Plaintext
HTTP is rejected unless `TG_BLOB_S3_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP=true` is explicitly
set for a loopback or compose-only endpoint; startup logs a warning when this
escape hatch is used. There is no TLS verification bypass setting.

A minimal run against a local Postgres, creating the first account through the
normal registration flow:

```bash
export TG_POSTGRES_DSN="postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/telegram?sslmode=disable"
make migrate
TG_AUTHKEY_ENC_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
TG_PUBLIC_LINK_PREFIX="https://links.example.test/" \
TG_REGISTRATION=open \
  make run
```

Complete the username registration flow in `docs/clients.md`, then restart with
`TG_REGISTRATION=closed`. Later accounts can use `invite` mode and the local
`telegramd invite` commands.

The full variable reference (rate limits, pre-auth connection bounds, PROXY
protocol support, upload limits) is in `docs/clients.md` and
`internal/config/config.go`, along with the sign-in and sign-up flows for both
account modes.

## Tests and lint

```bash
make test        # everything, -race; e2e runs in its own -count=1 invocation
make test-unit   # all packages except test/e2e, fast development loop
make test-db     # just internal/store
make lint        # golangci-lint run
```

These are the same targets CI runs (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs
`make test`). The Postgres tests need no setup beyond Docker:
`internal/pgtest` starts one reusable `tg-test-pg` container and clones a
fresh database per test from a template. When the tests themselves run inside
a container, the `make` targets join Docker's default bridge network first;
`docs/testing.md` explains why, and what to do when invoking `go test`
directly.

The admin dashboard has a browser e2e suite (Playwright, `test/e2e/admin.spec.ts`,
configured in `playwright.config.ts`), run as a separate CI job:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
pnpm test        # playwright test; starts its own server on 127.0.0.1:2444
pnpm lint        # eslint over test/e2e
```

## Migrations and codegen

Schema changes are Atlas migration files in `migrations/`, tracked by
`migrations/atlas.sum`. `atlas.hcl` defines the `local` env: the target
database comes from `TG_POSTGRES_DSN`, and validate/diff use a throwaway
`docker://postgres/16` dev database.

```bash
export TG_POSTGRES_DSN="postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/telegram?sslmode=disable"
make migrate-new name=add_sessions   # diff current schema into a new migration
make migrate                         # atlas migrate apply --env local
```

Hand-written migrations need `atlas migrate hash --env local` to update the
sum file. Details, including validation: `docs/migrations.md`.

Query changes: edit the SQL in `internal/store/queries`, then

```bash
make sqlc        # regenerate internal/store/db (alias: make generate)
```
