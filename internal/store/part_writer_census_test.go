// TestPartPrefixHasOneBoundedWriter pins the premise the orphan pass's
// temporary class rests on: "a Put that started before the cutoff is not still
// running". That holds because every writer whose bytes land under the parts
// prefix hands Put a payload of at most MaxPartBytes already in memory. The
// migration writer buffers parts only after checking that size limit; its
// assembled-key writes remain streamed. Normal assembly can genuinely run
// long while streaming a whole file out of its parts, but it writes under an
// assembled key, which the disjointness test in internal/blob shows can never
// fall under this prefix.
//
// The premise is a fact about the set of callers, so it is pinned as one: this
// census reds when a new Put appears anywhere in the tree, which is the
// moment somebody has to say which prefix it writes to and whether it is
// bounded. A staged or streamed write landing under parts/ would make an aged
// temporary there something other than an abandoned write, and the pass would
// unlink bytes a caller is still handing over.
