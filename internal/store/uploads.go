// SaveUploadPart writes one part of an in-flight upload, enforcing the per-file
// and per-user byte caps. maxFileBytes is the per-file cap; the per-user
// outstanding cap is twice that, which is two concurrent max-size uploads. The
// same outstanding set is capped by row count, because a row costs more than
// its payload in index and WAL and a 1-byte part pays almost nothing for one.
//
// The bytes go to the blob store under a random key the row records; Postgres
// keeps the accounting only. The order is the contract, and it is the reverse
// of the assembled-blob rule:
//
//  1. The caps are evaluated and the row is committed BEFORE any byte leaves
//     the process. The sums are read back inside the same transaction as the
//     upsert, so what they measure is the state the write would produce — the
//     same property the payload column used to buy: a client re-saving part 0
//     in a loop is not billed twice, because there is no counter to
//     increment, only a SUM over rows the upsert has already deduplicated.
//     Over a cap, the transaction rolls back and the request is refused
//     having stored nothing.
//  2. The bytes are written after the commit. A crash between the two leaves a
//     row with no bytes, which is the recoverable direction: the cap
//     over-counts, assembly fails closed, and the sweep retires the row on
//     schedule. An object with no row is invisible to the row-driven sweep
//     and permanent, so the reverse order is not an option.
//
// The recorded size is measured from the payload this call received, never
// from anything the client declared, and it describes the object the row names
// and no other: every save draws a fresh key, so size and key move together.
//
// A re-save therefore leaves the object it replaced named by nothing, and this
// deletes it once the row commits. Without that, a client retrying one part in
// a loop grows stored bytes without bound while the row-based caps — which
// count rows, not objects — stay flat.
//
// Two deletes, not one, and together they are what makes that hold under
// concurrency as well as serially: this save's own object is dropped too if the
// row has moved off it by the time the bytes are down. The advisory lock orders
// the rows of two concurrent saves of one part but not their byte work, so
// without the second delete the later saver's cleanup can run before the
// earlier saver's write and leave an object no row names — reachable on demand,
// not by any failure. With it, an orphan needs this process or the backend to
// fail between the write and the cleanup.
//
// Lock: one advisory lock on user_id, taken first, so one account's concurrent
// saves serialise and two of them cannot both read a sum that is under the cap
// and both commit. It is the same per-owner advisory namespace lockOwners uses
// in messages.go. The lock is held only for the transaction's life: the blob
// write happens after the commit, so a hanging storage backend cannot pin it.

//     went, deleted a second time after that transaction commits. A re-save
//     that committed in the window between the claim and the byte delete has

// The pass is safe in a way the row-driven sweep is not: it holds no lock a
// request path waits on, makes no storage call inside a transaction, and its
// only interaction with Postgres is a batched live-key lookup. Two replicas
// running it at once delete the same object twice, and the second delete is a
// no-op.
//
// cutoff is the earliest an object may be removed. The caller passes
// now-(TTL+margin); the pass clamps it to that floor so a misconfigured small
// cutoff cannot reach a live part. The margin (PartOrphanMargin) covers the
// row sweep's own lag plus one hour of clock skew; the live-key gate carries
// correctness alone, and this margin is defence in depth.
//
// What it acts on is narrower than what it sees, and each exclusion is a
// separate reason. A directory, a symlink or anything else not a regular file
// never came from the writer. What is left has to be a key NewPartKey could
// have produced, with or without the writer's temporary suffix: this pass pages
// candidates by walking paths rather than by reading upload_parts rows, which
// makes that shape check load-bearing for deletion rather than for a counter,
// so anything else parked under the prefix is unexplained and is left where it
// is for [blobscan] to report.
//
// A temporary file is judged by the same cutoff as a finished object rather
// than skipped. Skipping it would leave the bytes of a died-mid-write part
// reclaimable by nothing, which is the leak this pass exists to close; and a
// temporary older than TTL plus margin is not a write in progress, because a
// part is at most MaxPartBytes and a Put that started that long ago is not
// still running. It is gated on the key it is becoming, so a row that still
// names that key protects its temporary too.
//
// One run streams the entire prefix, so every orphan is examined on every run
// regardless of where its key sorts and how many ineligible objects precede
// it. The enumeration is one directory read per run, linear in the number of
// part objects and not quadratic, and the pass holds a batch of candidates
// rather than a listing. The bound is therefore independent of process uptime
// and of the store's contents: an unaccounted byte is reclaimed on the first
// run after it crosses the cutoff, and the residual bound is TTL + margin +
// one sweep interval.
//
// There is no delete-time re-check, and the streaming order is what carries
// that. A row is committed before its bytes are written (MAIN-341's ordering
// rule), so any row naming an object the walk observed was committed before
// that object existed, and the gate query that follows the observation sees
// it. A row committed after the walk passed a directory draws a fresh key from
// crypto/rand, so it names no object this run ever saw.
