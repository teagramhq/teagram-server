-- than the argument, so it is a recomputation and not a second copy of the same
-- assertion.
--
-- A future writer that changes usernames without coming through here leaves the
-- marker stale, and that is survivable by construction rather than by luck:
-- publicly_discoverable decides cost only, the pre-LIMIT JOIN usernames in
-- SearchPublicChannels decides disclosure, and a stale marker in the permissive

-- SearchPublicChannels finds the channels any account may discover by title or
-- by handle: exactly those owning a row in usernames.
--
-- The publicness predicate lives in the WHERE and therefore runs before LIMIT.
-- That position is the whole security property. A private channel matching the
-- tsquery must never occupy a row inside LIMIT that is then dropped in Go: the
-- caller reads the shortfall in the returned row count as "a private channel
-- matching my query exists", and probing LIMIT positions turns titles into an
-- enumeration oracle over channels that are supposed to be invisible.
--
-- The query takes no viewer, deliberately. Results is public discovery and is
-- identical for every caller, so nothing in it can vary with the caller's own
-- membership or ban state and be read back as information.
--
-- Publicness is decided by the usernames row rather than the denormalized
-- channels.username column. The two are written in one transaction today
-- (ClaimChannelUsername), but only the usernames row is authoritative, and a
-- future writer that releases a handle without clearing the copy must not leave
-- the channel discoverable. The handle returned to the caller comes from the
-- same row for the same reason: the username shown is the one that admitted the
-- channel to this result, never the copy.
--
-- publicly_discoverable in the title disjunct is not a second publicness test
-- and must never be read as one. The join above stays the only thing deciding
-- what this query returns; the marker decides what it costs. It is there so the
-- candidate set holds public channels only: a private title matching the token
-- was previously scanned, probed against usernames and discarded, so the time
-- an empty answer took counted the private channels sharing a guessed word.
-- With the marker in the predicate the partial index over public titles is the
-- only index that can answer it, so the cost of this arm tracks the public
-- matches — which the response discloses anyway — and nothing else.
--
-- The match is a union of two single-relation subqueries rather than one OR
-- spanning channels and usernames, and that shape is load-bearing rather than
-- stylistic. An OR across two relations cannot be answered from either index:
-- the planner scans every channel, joins every channel handle, and evaluates
-- the disjunction as a join filter, so a query matching nothing costs the whole
-- table (162.8 ms at 200k channels, against 1.99 ms here) and an authenticated
-- account picks that worst case for free by sending a nonsense token. Each
-- disjunct here restricts on its own relation, so the title arm is a bitmap
-- scan of channels_public_title_tsv_idx and the handle arm a lookup on the
-- usernames primary key.

-- It is written as an explicit id set rather than left to the planner because
-- the bound has to be structural. Without it the candidate set is every channel
-- whose title matches, private ones included, filtered down to the caller's
-- afterwards — so the cost of an empty answer counts the private channels
-- sharing the token, which is the oracle M16 closed. A plan that avoids that by
-- preference rather than by construction is one statistics change away from
-- returning to it, and "index-driven" does not rule it out: a bitmap scan of a
-- whole-table title index followed by a membership filter is index-driven and
-- is precisely the leaking shape. With the id set in the predicate, and no
-- index over every title left to scan, the plan is a primary-key scan over at
-- most the per-account channel cap (channels.go, defaultMaxChannelsPerUser),
-- whatever the corpus behind it looks like.
--
-- The handle disjunct stays unscoped, and needs no scope: it is a primary-key
-- lookup on usernames yielding at most one row, so it costs the same whatever
-- the corpus holds, and a private channel has no row there to find. A channel
-- it names that the caller does not belong to is dropped by the join above.
--
-- No participant count here, unlike the public arm: a member is rendered by
-- channelToTL, which carries no participants_count field, so counting would be
-- a per-row aggregate over channel_participants whose result is discarded.
