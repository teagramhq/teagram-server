// preAuthLogInterval bounds how often a pre-auth refusal is logged. Refusals are
// driven by whoever can reach the port, unauthenticated, so a line each is a log
// an attacker writes as fast as it can open sockets; the line that does come out
// says how many it stands for.
const preAuthLogInterval = 10 * time.Second

// PreAuthLimits bounds what connections that have not authenticated yet may hold
// at once. Everything before the first frame that decrypts under a key this
// server issued is reachable by anyone who can open a socket, and each such
// connection costs a descriptor and a goroutine.
//
// The three bounds are layered so that each one holds if the others are
// misconfigured, and together they make the worst case a formula rather than a
// hope: an unauthenticated population spread over k client networks holds at
// most min(MaxConns, k*MaxConnsPerNet) descriptors and the same number of
// goroutines, each for at most Lifetime. One network alone holds at most
// MaxConnsPerNet of each.
//
// Two exemptions are part of the formula rather than holes in it, and both are
// deliberate. A connection carrying no address the server may key on — a
// balancer's own health check, a peer the transport could not report — is
// charged to no network, so that population is bounded by MaxConns and Lifetime
// alone; keeping the allowlist to balancer addresses is what keeps it small.
// And these are pre-auth bounds: they end at the first frame that decrypts under
// a key this server issued, so one completed key exchange buys connections that
// none of the three hold. That is the intended line — a client between key
// exchange and sign-in is waiting on a human reading a code and must not be cut
// — and bounding what one such key may hold is a separate bound on separate
// state: it is DefaultMaxConnsPerUnboundKey's, not a number that belongs here.
//
// They are policy constants, not adaptive logic: nothing here reacts to load,
// keeps a reputation, or rate-limits opens. A connection is inside the bounds or
// it is closed.
//
// A zero field disables that bound, matching the rate-limit surfaces. Disabling
// all three restores the behaviour these bounds replaced, where one peer's hold
// on the server was limited only by its own patience.

	// MaxConns is the deployment-wide cap for concurrent pre-auth connections.

	// MaxConnsPerNet caps them per client network, so that one peer cannot spend
	// the global cap on its own and lock everybody else out. It is checked once
	// the connection layer has established the client address — the one a PROXY
	// v2 header reports when the server runs behind a balancer, never the socket
	// peer, which behind a balancer is the same for every client on earth.
	//
	// Network, not address, and the distinction is the whole bound for IPv6:
	// store.IPBucketKey is what the per-IP rate limits already key on, an
	// address for IPv4 and a /64 for IPv6, because a host on a normal v6
	// allocation mints fresh addresses inside its own /64 for free. Keyed on the
	// address, this cap would not bind for such a host at all, and it is the
	// only thing standing between one peer and the whole of MaxConns.

	// Lifetime is the hard ceiling on the pre-auth state, measured from accept.
	// A connection that has not authenticated within it is closed whatever it is
	// doing, which is what ends the hold no deadline catches: every read the
	// server does re-derives its own deadline, so a peer sending one small frame
	// just inside each of them keeps its socket indefinitely for a few bytes a
	// minute.
	//
	// It is not a handshake timeout. Transport negotiation has its own, tighter
	// bound; this one covers everything up to and including key exchange, and
	// gotd applies a 60s DefaultTimeout per read inside that, so a ceiling below
	// a minute would start cutting handshakes that are merely slow.

// count; the lifetime applies independently to each connection.
//
// The per-network number is the one that has to be argued rather than chosen. It
// is a concurrency cap, not a rate: a client completes a handshake in
// milliseconds, so 64 in flight at once is hundreds of new sessions a second
// from a single network — far above a real client and, importantly, above a
// carrier NAT or a corporate egress, where thousands of subscribers share the
// address the server sees. The global number sits well under any descriptor
// ceiling worth running with, so the process keeps descriptors for the
// authenticated sessions that pay for it.
