// A key exchange used to buy a hold that nothing counted. The pre-auth bounds
// end at the first frame that decrypts under a key this server issued, and the
// per-user connection cap counts only signed-in sessions, so a key that never
// signs in sat between the two: one exchange, ever, and then as many concurrent
// connections from as many addresses as the peer cared to open. These tests are
// that gap, and the two counterweights that must survive closing it — the
// client waiting on a human to read a login code, and the session that has
// since signed in.

// TestUnboundKeyCapBoundsWhatOneKeyHolds drives the reuse pattern itself: many
// sockets, one key that never signs in, each socket sending frames that decrypt
// under it. Past the cap the connections are closed, the ones inside it are
// left alone, and a slot comes back when its connection ends.
