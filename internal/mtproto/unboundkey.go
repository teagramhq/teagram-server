// DefaultMaxConnsPerUnboundKey is the shipped deployment-wide bound on what
// one auth key with no signed-in user may hold: 8 concurrent connections.
//
// It is the analogue, for keys nobody has signed in on, of MaxUserConns, and it
// closes the gap between that cap and the pre-auth bounds. Those bounds end at
// the first frame that decrypts under a key this server issued, and MaxUserConns
// counts only signed-in sessions, so a key that completed one exchange and never
// signed in was counted by neither: one exchange, ever, bought a peer unlimited
// concurrent connections from any number of addresses.
//
// The number is small because the population it bounds is small. A client
// between key exchange and sign-in is waiting on a human reading a code and
// holds one connection under its key; a few more only while a dropped socket
// has not yet been noticed. Eight leaves that room and still makes the hold a
// formula: a peer wanting more concurrent connections needs another key, and
// another key needs another exchange, which the pre-auth bounds already price.
//
// It is a policy constant, not adaptive logic: nothing here reacts to load or
// keeps a reputation. Zero disables it, matching the pre-auth bounds and the
// rate-limit surfaces, and restores the unbounded hold this replaced.
